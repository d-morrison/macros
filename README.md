# macros

This repository contains LaTeX macros for mathematical notation used in statistical and regression modeling, originally from the [rme repository](https://github.com/d-morrison/rme).

## Contents

- `macros.qmd`: LaTeX macro definitions for use in Quarto documents

These macros provide convenient shorthand for common mathematical expressions used in:
- Probability and statistics
- Regression models (linear, logistic, Poisson, survival analysis)
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Mathematical notation (vectors, matrices, derivatives, etc.)
